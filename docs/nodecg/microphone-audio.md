# Microphone Audio

These hold some microphone settings that may need adjustment during the event.

## Microphone Indicator Activation dB

A global threshold that is needed for someone speaking on the microphone to indicate that they are speaking in the graphics.

For quiet speakers this may need to be increased. For louder speakers it may need to be lowered. Just do it on feel.

## Host Unmute Audio Level

When Hosts are unmuted this is the value they get set to. For louder hosts it will need to be lower, for quieter host it will need to be increased.

I recommend manually modifying the fader on X32 Edit to get a sense of where you need to set it.
