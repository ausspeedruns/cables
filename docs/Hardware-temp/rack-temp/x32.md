# Behringer X32 Rack

Our workhorse is the Behringer X32 Rack. It is the big box that all the audio cables are going in. This document serves to show where each cable goes in and what each channel and mixbus is used for.

In writing this article it really showed me how complex and confusing the X32 routing is. I've been working with it for 3 years and am only now getting some sort of grasp.

## Why?

## I/O

The X32 Rack has a good amount of I/O. Not as much as it's bigger brothers but enough for our use.
