# software manager instructions

Instructions that normally Clubwho does but if he were to be hit by a bus (or enjoying the Formula 1) these instructions are important.

## Start of Event

At the start of the event we normally do an Acknowledgement of Country. Normally the coordinator of the event does the speech so you need to coordinate with them on how they want to do it. This can be done either via the normal runner cam or the crowd camera. The "IRL" scene should be used as it has a lowerthird for both the nameplate and an Acknowledgement of Country.

These controls are seen on the "ASM Misc" tab in NodeCG under the "Full Cam" panel. The name plate buttons are called "Credits Name" and "Credits Title" with the relevant controls below. The Acknowledgement of Country buttons are called "Show AOC" and "Hide AOC".

You may need to manually mix during the scene. Remember both Stream AND Speakers.

## Transition to Normal Event

You might have to move a camera back to normal but that's it. Just regular programming from then on.

## End of Event

At the end of the event the coordinator tends to do another speech thanking everyone and wrapping the event up. Use the "IRL" scene. Ask when the coordinator would like to roll the credits (normally they will just call it out to start the credits). On the "ASM Misc" tab in NodeCG under the "Full Cam" panel press "Roll Credits".
