In essence the swap over is that the current runner needs to be yeeted and the next runner setup. Once the runner has all their stuff plugged in then you need to make sure that OBS is getting video and the X32 is getting audio (the runner is normally first to notice no audio).

Ideally you will have a "Stage Hand" (secondary) to help you with the swap over. If you are on your own then it is a bit more tricky but still doable.

The 3 crucial things that you need to go live are:

- Game Video
- Game Audio
- Runner Audio

Everything else can be done later if we are running behind and we need to go live quickly.

The swap over can be seen as 3 stages:

1. [Preparing for the next runner](#preparing-for-the-next-runner)
2. [Setting up the next runner](#setting-up-the-next-runner)
3. [Going live](#going-live)

## Preparing for the next runner

We need to get rid of the previous runner and find the next runner.

### Stage Hand {#prep-stage-hand}

1. 15 Minutes before the end of the run the next runner needs to be found.
   - Talk to Front Desk to see if they know where the runner is.
   - Make sure they are all ready to go (and let them know if we need to be speedy if we are behind schedule).
2. Once the stream is on Intermission the current runner equipment needs to be cleared.
   - Politely ask the runner to hurry up if we are behind schedule.
3. Headsets, keyboard and mice need to be wiped down.

### Stream Tech {#prep-stream-tech}

1. Note any special requirements for the next runner.
2. Wait for runner to finish talking (Normally 15-30 seconds).
   - If we are ahead on time then they can talk as long as they want.
   - If we are behind on time then try to cut them off as soon as you can.
     - People WILL talk for ages if you let them because they don't actually know *how* to stop.
3. Transition away from current scene to **INTERMISSION**.

## Setting up the next runner

### Stage Hand {#setup-stage-hand}

1. Setup next runner's equipment (consoles, controllers, etc).
2. If the runner is using an [SD Console](./video-flow.md#sd-consoles) then help setup the RetroTINK.
3. Assist runners and commentators with the Runner Tablet to make sure their name, headset and personal audio levels are correct.

### Stream Tech {#setup-stream-tech}

1. In OBS
   1. Select the correct aspect ratio scene.
   2. Check that OBS is getting video.
   3. Adjust cropping on OBS video.
2. Check that the X32 is getting audio.
3. Mix the audio levels using the "**Preview**" mix bus on the X32.
   - Do this by selecting the "Preview" mix bus on the bottom right of X32 Edit then "Solo" on the channel strip on the right above the slider/fader.
   - Remember to hit "Clear Solo" when done.
4. If multiple people running, check names on graphic match with sitting order AND the video matches.
5. Adjust the camera to make sure the runner and commentators are in shot.

## Going live

### Stage Hand {#live-stage-hand}

1. If ahead of schedule inform the runner and host that we will wait for X minutes.
   - Discuss with Stream Tech if we can afford to wait.
2. Inform runner that the host will introduce them, then we will transition and then they can talk.
3. After we are live, walk around the crowd to check audio levels.
   - Inform Stream Tech if adjustments are needed.
4. When live start taking photos for social media.
5. Keep area tidy.

### Stream Tech {#live-stream-tech}

1. Wait until the runner is ready.
2. Give host the go ahead to start.
   - Either through a thumbs up or via Talkback.
3. Wait until the Host has completed their introduction then Hit transition in OBS.
4. Make sure the timer starts.
   - Host can forget sometimes after a long shift.
5. Adjust Speaker audio.
   - You tend to need to turn the game up a bit compared to the stream.
6. Monitor chat for any issues.
7. Breathe.
8. Be alert for any issues and make note of them on the checklist.
9. Search up what the end of the speedrun looks like so you can prepare for it.
