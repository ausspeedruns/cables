title: How to do a swap over
sidebar_position: 2
---

In essence the swap over is that the current runner needs to be yeeted and the next runner setup. Once the runner has all their stuff plugged in then you need to make sure that OBS is getting video and the X32 is getting audio (the runner is normally first to notice no audio).

The swap over can be seen as 3 stages:

1. [Preparing for the next runner](#preparing-for-the-next-runner)
2. [Setting up the next runner](#setting-up-the-next-runner)
3. [Going live](#going-live)

## Preparing for the next runner

We need to get rid of the previous runner and find the next runner.

1. Next runner needs to be found.
2. Wait for runner to finish yapping away.
3. Transition away from current runner to intermission.
4. Current runner equipment needs to be cleared.
5. Headsets, keyboard and mice need to be wiped down.

## Setting up the next runner

1. Setup next runner's equipment (consoles, controllers, etc).
2. In OBS
   1. Select the correct aspect ratio scene.
   2. Check that OBS is getting video.
   3. Adjust cropping on OBS video.
3. Check that the X32 is getting audio.
4. If multiple people running, check names on graphic match with sitting order.

## Going live

1. Wait until runner is ready.
2. If ahead of schedule inform the runner and host that we will wait for X minutes.
3. Inform runner that the host will introduce them and then we will transition and then they can talk.
4. Give host the go ahead to start.
5. Hit transition in OBS.
6. Adjust Stream audio.
7. Adjust Speaker audio.
8. Monitor chat for any issues.
9. Breathe

## If there is a secondary on shift

The basis of secondary is that they handle the stage tech while primary handles the computer and OBS.
