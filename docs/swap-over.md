title: How to do a swap over
---

In essence the swap over is that the current runner needs to be yeeted and the next runner setup. Once the runner has all their stuff plugged in then you need to make sure that OBS is getting video and the X32 is getting audio (the runner is normally first to notice no audio).

## Things that need to occur

1. Next runner needs to be found
2. Transition away from current runner to intermission
3. Current runner equipment needs to be cleared
4. Setup next runner's equipment (consoles, controllers, etc)
5. Select the correct aspect ratio
6. Check that OBS is getting video
7. Check that the X32 is getting audio
8. Adjust cropping on OBS video
9. If multiple people running, check names on graphic match with sitting order
10. Wait until runner is ready
11. If ahead of schedule inform the runner and host via talkback that we will wait for X minutes.
12. Inform runner that the host will introduce them and then we will transition and then they can talk.
13. Give host the go ahead to start
14. Transition in
15. Adjust Stream audio
16. Adjust OBS audio
17. Monitor chat for any issues
