# RetroTINK 5X-Pro

## Setup
1. Power the RetroTINK by plugging in the USB cable.
2. Connect your SD console's video out to the RetroTINK. This will be either:
   - `Composite` (yellow, white and red RCA)
     - Plug the yellow RCA into the green jack
   - `S-Video` (black 4-pin DIN connector + white and red RCA jacks)
   - `Component` (red, blue, green white and red RCA)
   - `SCART` (black 21-pin connector)
3. Change the Input source to the correct one, either by pressing the `Input` button on the Tink itself (which cycles through each option), or using the remote, under `[Input]` in the settings menu.
>If the video is black and white, that usually just means you're on the wrong input. 
4. Done!

## Settings/Troubleshooting

When you plug in the RetroTINK, it will load the default profile. This should be fine for most games.
### [HDMI]
#### V-Sync
- Use `Frame Lock` whenever possible for minimum lag.  
- If the game changes resolution, it may drop signal. Try switching the V-Sync to `Triple Buffer`.  
#### VRR
- Keep this set to `FreeSync`. this prevents signal dropouts when dealing with unusual refresh rates.
